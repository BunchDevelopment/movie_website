# Movie Trailer Project

Uses Python to create an HTML website, and populate it with my top 6 favorite movies. Each movie should have a movie poster, plot description
 and a trailer that pops up when you click on the movie. 

## Getting Started

To load the webpage, open up entertainment_center.py and the webpage will open.
